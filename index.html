        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a first year Interaction Design Student at the University of Limerick. I chose this course because I have a huge interest in graphic design mainly and 
            photo manipulation. Although as I have continued with this course I have grown to enjoy product design elements and web development. I am from county Galway 
            originally and my main interests would be soccer, movies and poker. My career ambitions and future goals would mainly to be working in a job I enjoy and to have 
            stability. </p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p><strong>Future Goals:</strong> In the future I hope to pursue a career in graphic design and other related areas. Hopefully working for myself and from anywhere
             so I can pursue other goals while keeping up with my work at the same time.</p>

        <p><strong>People Who Inspire Me:</strong> The two people I would say that inspire me most are, Linus Tech Tips, who is a content creator who builds pc's and other
             machines, and Steve Jobs because he was a person who kinda came from nothing and amounted to huge success.</p>

        <p><strong>Hobbies & Passions:</strong> My main hobbies at the moment are going to the gym and playing poker with my friends. My main passions would be graphic design 
            and web development.</p>

        <p><strong>My favourite Projects:</strong> My favourite projects so far have been the album cover I had to design for graphic design last semester and this portfolio 
            website for web developement.</p>

        <h2>Reflection & Future Plans</h2>
        <p>I feel that this page reflects me well, although I would like to add more dynamic sections and make the website seem more "alive" rather than the static feel 
            it has now. If i were to expand the webiste then I would like to add sections displaying my work done so far, some pictures and videos.</p>
